#' [H2O](http://h2o.ai) is an open-source, fast, scalable and all around wonderful platform for machine learning. It is Java-based but it has an R interface which I use for the Pump it Up competition. (The [caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) package is great as well and it contains more models for prediction.)
#' 
#' First install the H2O package by following the instructions for R users in the [H2O documentation](http://docs.h2o.ai). Then start an H2O instance.

#' The classes are quite imbalanced and the random forest predicts the largest class, functional, with the highest accuracy and the smallest class, needs repair, with almost 70% error.
#'
#' If the model is overfitted, the performance might not generalize to the test set. Cross validation can help to avoid this problem. (Use the `nfolds` option in `h2o.randomForest`.)
#'
#' Make predictions for the test data. `h2o.predict` returns both the most likely class and the the probability for belonging to each class. A submission for the Pump it Up challenge needs only the predicted class, in the first column.

#+
predictions = as.data.frame(h2o.predict(rfHex,testHex))[,1]

#' Finally, save the predictions in the required format as a csv file.

#+
submission = tbl_dt(fread("../data/SubmissionFormat.csv")) %>%
  mutate(status_group = predictions)

#' `h2o.randomForest` is just one of the available algorithms. Other machine learning methods to experiment with are `h2o.gbm`, `h2o.deeplearning` or `h2o.naiveBayes`.
